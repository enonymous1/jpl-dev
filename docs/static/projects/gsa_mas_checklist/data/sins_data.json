Additional requirements specifically for Identity Protection Services are found in the notes section referenced below.^^^^NOTE 1: Additional Proposal Instructions related to Identity Protection Services (IPS) are found in IPS Requirements Document 1B.^^^^NOTE 2: Any firm offering Identity Protection Services will be required to provide a System Security Plan (SSP) in accordance with the template found in IPS Requirement Document 1C. The firm will also be required to submit a Firm Fixed Price as outlined in IPS Pricing Document 2, unless otherwise defined at the Task Order level (e.g. per product redeemed per the agreed-upon coverage period (month, year, etc.) ) covering ALL services cited in Section I of IPS Requirements Document 1A. If defined otherwise at the Task Order level, it must still be able to be mapped to the awarded Schedule contract pricing. Firms are encouraged to provide separate line item pricing for key services within this total solution SIN that the firm believes could be ordered independently (e.g., credit monitoring, restoration, etc). This will allow the Ordering Agency to obtain only those services needed depending on level of breach. See IPS Pricing Document 2 for pricing tables.  ^^^^NOTE 3: Services provided shall be performed in accordance with applicable Federal laws and policies, including the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998, as amended by Public Law 105-318, 112 Statute 3007 (Oct. 30, 1998), and implemented by 18 U.S.C. 1028.

Unique Identification (UID) is a system of distinguishing one object from another. UID of items requires that qualifying items have a data matrix inscribed either directly on the item or on a permanent machine-readable label affixed to the item. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a method of remotely storing and retrieving data using devices called RFID tags/transponders. An RFID tag is a small object integrated with a silicon chip, such as an adhesive sticker, that can be attached to or incorporated into a product. RFID tags contain antennas to enable them to receive and respond to radio-frequency queries from an RFID transceiver. RFID allows for individual items to have a unique identifier and can identify many items at once. RFID enables consumer packaged goods companies, retailers and other industries to improve their operating efficiency throughout their supply chains.",
